    "Let's go further.  This time we shall produce the latest 30-day time-series for all Regions.  Each of these charts will show the top 5 UTLAs for the region in terms of 7-day rolling sum per 100,000 population positive COVID-19 cases.\n",

    "There's nothing really new in this example, apart from the complexity.  To make this easier to manage, we break the full query down into a set of common table expressions (CTEs).  Essentially we need to perform 2 separate rankings.  One set of rankings is used to generate the top 5 UTLAs and we do this based on the latest date.  The other is ranked by date so we can filter out only the latest 30 days.  We then join these together.  It's pretty easy to modify the query below to change the timescale (to more or less than 30 days) as well as how much UTLAs are included in each region's rankings.\n",
